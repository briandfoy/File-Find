# The Perl 6 File::Find module from brian d foy

Traverse a directory tree and select files.

## Installation

Checkout the [latest sources](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find) then install from that directory:

	zef install .

There's already another `File::Find` and I'm not sure how `zef` handles authorities.

## Contributing

Fork [perl6-file-find](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find), edit, commit, and send a pull request!

If it's something non-trivial, you might consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find/issues) first.
