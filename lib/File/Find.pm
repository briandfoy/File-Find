=head1 NAME

File::Find - Get a lazy list of a directory tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use File::Find;

	my @list := find( dir => 'foo' );
	say @list[0..3];

	my $list = find( dir => 'foo' );
	say $list[0..3];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<File::Find> searches a directory tree for files that matches various
conditions that you choose. A file must match every condition that you
specify.

When you assign to a positional you get an eager list; otherwise you
get a lazy list.

=head2 (Str|Regex) name

Return files whose basename smart matches against this value.

Default: Any

=head2 (Str) type

Only return entries of the named file type. The available types are
C<file>, C<dir> or C<symlink>.

Default: Empty

=head2 (Callable) code

Return files that make the code evaluate to C<True>. The code have
zero or one parameters. With one parameter the argument is the IO
object that represents the file.

To Do: Recognize various exceptions to stop the whole process

=head2 (Str|Bool|IO) exclude

Exclude is meant to be used for skipping certain big and uninteresting
directories, like '.git'. Neither them nor any of their contents will be
returned, saving a significant amount of time.

The value of C<exclude> will be smartmatched against each IO object
found by File::Find. It's recommended that it's passed as an IO object
(or a Junction of those) so we avoid silly things like slashes
vs backslashes on different platforms.

=head2 (Num) max-depth

Descend only this deep.

Default: Inf

=head2 (Bool) breadth-first

Process new directories last. Files are treated as a LIFO.

Default: True

=head2 (Bool) recursive

(Deprecated) This sets the C<max-depth> to zero if C<False>.

Default: True

=head2 (Bool) stop-on-error

If there's an error reading a directory, stop immediately.

Default: False

=head2 (Bool) follow-symlinks

Follow symlinks.

Beware! This might put you in a part of the filesystem above where you
started.

Default: False
